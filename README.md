# Carousel in Bootstrap

The aim of this exercise is to provide a carousel using the technologies of Bootstrap.

## UX

As a user, I would expect indicators on the carousel.

As a user, I would expect captions on the carousel on medium-sized devices.  The captions would include the location (e.g. Wendover Road, Bromley) and when it was taken (e.g. 19 September 2020).

The [images](images/) are supplied.

## Features

There are indicators as well as previous and next buttons.

## Technologies

This project uses HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5.0.0-beta3 and Google Fonts (e.g. Nanum Gothic).  Includes Popper and then the Bootstrap JavaScript Plugins.

## Testing

Ensure that user stories have been met.

## Deployment

Deployed on [GitHub Pages] at the main branch.  To update any changes, use the command:

    git push
